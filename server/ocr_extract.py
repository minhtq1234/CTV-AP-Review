"""Extract key fields (with bboxes) from an OCR'd PDF packet into a CtvFolder manifest.

Pure geometry/text logic (scale, line grouping, bbox union, diacritic-insensitive
normalization, anchored pattern search, field assembly) is unit-tested on
synthetic OCR word lists — no PDF/Tesseract needed. The I/O layer (PyMuPDF
render + pytesseract) is verified by running on real packets (see
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-upload-split-ocr-validate-design.md).

Output shape matches src/ctv/types.ts exactly (CtvFolder/EvidenceDoc/DocPage/
CtvField/CtvSource) so manifests load straight into the existing reviewer.
